Create a new HTML file for your login/signup page and add the necessary HTML tags, such as <html>, <head>, <body>, etc.

Create a form in your HTML file using the <form> tag. The form should include fields for the user's email address or phone number, their password, and a button to submit the form.

Add CSS to your HTML file to style your login/signup form. You can use CSS to change the colors, fonts, and layout of your form.

Write JavaScript code to handle the form submission. When the user submits the form, your JavaScript code should validate the user's input and send the data to a server-side script to create a new user account or authenticate an existing user.

Integrate the Facebook Login API into your login/signup page if you want to allow users to sign up or log in using their Facebook account. This involves creating a Facebook App, configuring the Facebook Login settings, and adding the Facebook Login button to your HTML form.
